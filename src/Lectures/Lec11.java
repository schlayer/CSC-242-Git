	 Propositional Logic - Take what is implicit in what we know and make it explicit.
	 	Truth preserving: rewrite sentences to preserve truth. 
	 
	 Modus Ponens: if A implies B and A is given, then B can be inferred
	 Sound Inference Rule: If A logically implies B, A entails B
	 Completeness: If A entails B, B is implied by A (not always true!)
	 	Derives logically entailed sentences
	 
	 Following inference rules, we are guaranteed to find only things that are true. 
	 
	 
	 Propositional Inference as Search - use inference rules
	 I.E. if a or b or c or d is true, but we know c is not, then we know either a or b or d is true.
