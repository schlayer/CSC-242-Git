/*
 	Hill-Climbing Search
		Heuristic defines a 'landscape' so we have an idea of how good or bad the states are. 
		Your program tries to 'climb the highest mountain'
		Always tries to do what's best. (Greedy local search)	
		Can get stuck in a state where it cannot 'win' (finds solution 14% of the time)
			Looks for a global max but easily gets stuck in a local max
			(min if minimizing cost)
	
	Random Restart Strategy
		Just try random crap until we are at a solution
			Not very effective...
		OR: try an intelligent algorithm until it works, which is actually legit
		(Only works if you can use any initial state)
		
		Could try randomly picking actions that are 'better' than current state (stochastic hill climbing)
