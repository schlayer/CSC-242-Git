		Toy problems: Made-up situations that ignore most of the real world, but present a scenario
		with a few select problems which are close to real-world problems. Thus, solving them will
		provide valuable solutions. 
		
		We use abstractions to simplify real-world phenomena.
		
		
			For problem solving:
		-what are we trying to solve?
		-what real-world information do we need to solve it?
		
		CS is a science of abstraction. 
		
		
		"State" represents aspects of the world that we think matter to solving the problem. At current time.
		"Actions" change the state (move to a new location, etc.)
		Not all actions are applicable in every state. 
		Solutions are sequences of actions that get to a goal state, and they have a cost associated with them. 
		Path cost is the solutions cost, step cost is the cost of actions to reach the solution. 
		
		Problem domain: Actions S, Actions A (actions in a can be executed in given state s)
		s + a = s' (new state)
		cost(s, a, s') assigns a cost to each path/step
		
		Problem (instance) involves initial state I, and goal states G
		
		Deciding how to represent states and actions is important!
		Always need to know if an action can be performed, and what state results from a given 
		action being performed.
		
		
		Extremely general purpose algorithm, state space search... etc.
